# Health Risk Analysis from Wearable Data 🩺📊

This project analyzes wearable device data (heart rate, steps, and sleep patterns) to predict potential health risks. It is a mini project for the Data Analytics and Modelling subject and is built using **Streamlit**, **scikit-learn**, and **pandas**.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload wearable data (CSV format)
- Preprocess and visualize key health indicators
- Predict health risk levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Display model accuracy
- Downloadable prediction results (CSV)
- Interactive web interface (Streamlit)

## 🧠 Model Used

- **Classifier**: Decision Tree (can be swapped for others)
- **Inputs**: Heart rate, steps, sleep hours
- **Target**: Risk level (High, Medium, Low)

## 🗃️ Example Input Data Format

Upload a CSV file with the following columns:

```csv
timestamp,heart_rate,steps,sleep_hours
2024-01-01 00:00:00,75,3200,6.8
2024-01-01 02:00:00,90,1000,4.5
...

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/health-risk-wearable.git
cd health-risk-wearable
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Train the Model

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will generate the `models/risk_model.pkl` file.

### 4. Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🌐 Deployment

You can deploy this app for free using [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud). Just connect your GitHub repository and click **"Deploy"**.
